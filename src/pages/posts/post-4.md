📽️   Kaathal – The Core (2023)

🖋️ Malayalam 

🌟 The one touches right to the core as a statement..!

🌀 An unusual experience where content speaks louder than frames.

📜 Narrative slowly builds over the marital space of Omana (Jyothika) and Mathew (Mamooty), which gradually slips into an irreparable zone.

🍁 First half wholly delves into the unfolding of the characters with their soul rooted in a serene village.

🌊 Tale takes an unexpected turn post-interval, and that's the charm it explores.

🌼 Omana is plotted as a part-time professional who balances her work life within the home's walls.

✨ Mathew, at present, is a retired bank employee currently occupied with the election in his ward as one of the contestants.

spoilers ahead

🌫️ The first scene glimpses the imbalances in the couple's equation when Omana apathetically expresses herself to her daughter about Mathew.

🧩 The moody clouds in the family get stirred into a cyclone as Omana legally proceeds to the dissolution of the marriage.

🎳 Mathew seems surprised and lost, not knowing the impulse behind it.

☘️ Contrasts in the family also shake Mathew's daughter and his father, who, with extreme conviction, have been captured and translated to the audience.

💫 In this dilemma, the director widens his angle to the character, Thankan, in his 50s, who indeed is battling with his solitude and finds meaning in life in bringing up his niece.

🏷️ The gradual and natural transition to the courtroom unravels the mystery behind Omana's decision to part ways.

📌 Contrary to family and societal expectations, Omana strengthens herself with the vision she has meticulously shaped during two decades of marriage.

📍Guiding her daughter and channelling her father-in-law's voice showcased the mother's heartfelt commitment. 

🔒Her enduring silence over decades revealed a deep commitment to safeguarding Matthew. 

🔆 Enduring distress until ensuring her family's support highlights her selfless dedication.

🤌🏻 Acknowledging the couple's profound respect despite differences, it's evident as Omana seeks a final hug, Mathew carries her bag into court, and they share a gentle handshake.

🪭 Kudos to the team for tactfully addressing the topic through:

- Carefully selecting the cast.

- Crafting a compelling narrative with the apt age for Mathew and Omana, encouraging reflection on marital preferences versus reality.

- Poignantly depicting Mathew's dad's sorrow and belated realization.

- Commendably breaking age and generation barriers in the narrative.

- Maturely handling the delicate topic with emotions that speak beyond touch.

- Thoughtfully presenting respectful arguments on homosexuality in court.

🎼Salute to background music and song in the climax for appearing only when it was crucial.

✌🏻Sepcial mention of Jomol's brilliant voice-over for Jyotika that has been truly exceptional.

🙌🏻 Applauds to the production house for having dared to funnel the voice without a fuss.

⛔ Jyothika's performance might have been more impactful if she had conveyed the character's depth through expressive body language.

👉🏻 Highly recommended to watch with family and have an open discussion with your parents-children-partner.
